Kimberly is from a suburb just south of Atlanta, Georgia. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology with Highest Honors, majoring in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering and minoring in Scientific and Engineering Computing (under the College of Computing). 

At Georgia Tech, Kimberly worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant, a peer tutor, and an undergraduate researcher. As an undergraduate researcher, she worked in [Professor Martin Maldovan's](https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/people/martin-maldovan) group with [Dr. Juan Manuel Restrepo-Florez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VLMa-k0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en), where she worked on modeling a pipe-in-pipe reactor using COMSOL for the production of syn gas.

Kimberly is now attending the University of California, Berkeley to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. She works with [Professor Ali Mesbah](https://www.mesbahlab.com) where her research focuses on predictive control, optimization, and machine learning for cold atmospheric plasma jets in biomedical applications. *Details found under Projects*

In January 2023, Kimberly also started as a Pathways Intern at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center. At Ames, she works with [Dr. Jeremy Coupe](https://aviationsystems.arc.nasa.gov/about/bios/coupe_jeremy.shtml) on machine learning methods with graph representations for air traffic management. *Details found under Projects*
